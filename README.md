This app consists of a simple login page, a "create a new password" page with a form for resetting users' passwords, and a "success page" that indicates that a task was completed successfully and redirects back to the login page.

This was done solely to show my students how to create a simple login page and make it functioning. Also, to show how navigation and screens function.
